# semantikeys
A game-ish-thing inspired by text-based adventures, games like Uplink, and old websites.

## Weird clarification
This feels weird to explicitly type out, but there have been few games that breach the 4th wall of your computer (Undertale, Pony Island) by making themselves crash or adding files to your desktop or whatever. While in good fun, this is not the case with this game. Besides clickable links to download static files (.txt, .jpeg...) from within the installation, no changes will be made to your filesystem or anything of the sort. The game is supposed to play out entirely in the confines of your browser.
